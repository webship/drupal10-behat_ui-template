# Console Log Report Format folder

Configure Behat UI settings to use this folder on
"/admin/config/development/behat-ui/settings"

Only when "Enable HTML Report Format" is not checked
and "Console Log report directory" is configured to this folder.
and you do have a "Console Log report file" file name behat-ui-test.log
or a .log or .out file to which will be used in the log reporting.
